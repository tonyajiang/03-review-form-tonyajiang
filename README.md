* The form should submit to the URL `http://kraigh.com/cse104/reviews.php` using the method `post`.
* The form should have two fieldsets- one for name and email fields, and one for the review fields.
* All form fields should be properly labeled using one of the two methods learned in class.
* The form needs the following fields with the specified name:
    * Full name using the name `name`
    * Email using the HTML5 `email` input type and name `email`
    * Menu selection drop-down using the name `menu` and options with values `steak`, `chicken`, and `vegetarian`
    * Rating radio buttons with name `rating` and values `1` - `5`
    * Checkboxes for the user to indicate if they were greeted upon entering and existing the restaurant. Use name `greeted[]` and values `entered` and `exited`

Upon submitting your form, you will be taken to a page where you can see all reviews for the restaurant. Before submitting the assignment, ensure that you see your own submissions in the list. Note, the email field will not appear on this page for privacy reasons.
